# TourBookingSystem
This is a system that develop by Rust, which provides user a way to manage their tour information. **It just an assignment from school, but it is good enough to use the basic function right now.**

**Attention**: if you want to run it in your computer, you must make sure: 
1. you have downloaded and installed Rust Compiler(rustc stable) in your computer.
2. you have a mysql database in your computer that owns a user named `root` while its password is `12345678` at the same time.
3. your database must run the `.sql` script the same as mine.
